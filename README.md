## Overview
This project focuses on improving the accuracy of stock market predictions by integrating sentiment analysis derived from financial news and social media content with traditional financial indicators. Our target is the SPY ETF, which mirrors the S&P 500, using a combination of machine learning techniques and sentiment data to predict future price movements.


## Data
- **SPY Data**: Historical daily data from Bloomberg covering the period from January 2, 2015, to December 31, 2019.
- **Sentiment Data**: Extracted from over 1.7 million public tweets and financial news headlines, focusing on major tech companies and general market sentiment.

## Methodology
1. Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing NLP models like FinTwitBert and distilroberta-finetuned-financial-news for extracting sentiment from tweets and news respectively.

2. Forecasting Models:
- Logistic Regression: For predicting the direction of stock returns.
- Random Forest and XGBoost: For classifying the movement direction of the SPY within specified prediction windows.
